# Work Breakdown
- Prototype movement mechanics
- Design lane segments
	- Probability-based?
	- Generative algorithm?

## Post-Prototype
- Refactor `CharacterBoat` and `AllyBoat` to inherent from a base class: `Boat`. Lots of duplicated code to get it working

## Stuff that always gets left until last
- Intro cinematic/VFX (launching the boats? Some kind of paper-folding cinematic?)
- Simple menu required (Ollie has a top-right settings button that can be pasted in from another project)
